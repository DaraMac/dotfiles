# Setup
Designed to use [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow).
Run `stow name` while in this directory to symlink the configuration file(s) for that name to the appropriate location.
Or just [symlink manually](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link).

The 'others' directory has configuration files that aren't meant to be symlinked anywhere, but instead directly loaded into the appropriate program.
