dotfiles
========

Where files should go:
----------------------

A name ending in a "/" indicates it refers to a directory.
* i3/ -> ~/.config/
* i3config/ -> ~/.config/
* gitconfig -> ~/.gitconfig
* vimrc -> ~/.vimrc

### Notes ###
Currently calcurse launcher is non-portable as it explicitly launches gnome-terminal.
